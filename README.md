The following website is for a non profit organisation called Mental Mania ( its a fictional organisation). This organisation goal is to help people with their mental health problems. The website is currently in the beginning stages, so its operating on html only. The website is simple as to allow for easy access for people of the inteded age group. The website uses html tags in order to make the code neater and more presentable. The website is made up of five different pages, these include a home page, about us page, services page, donations page and a conatct us page. Some pages such as the services page contain i frames and <a hrefs. This is used to link resources such as youtube videos and external links to other sources of infromation. The pages use hyper links in order to seamlessly switch between the different pages. 




Changelog: This is an updated version of the website as this versions now includes:

- CSS has been added to give the website a more visually appealing look
- More content has been added to both the home page as well as the about us page
- Clickable links that lead to socials and donations have been added (since the organisation is not real the links don't actually work)
